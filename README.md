# MIPS Assembly Programming Assignments
This repository contains MIPS assembly programs implemented for the assignments. Each program addresses a specific task as outlined below:

## Program Descriptions:
**reverse.asm**: This program receives the number of lines of input, followed by the lines of text, and prints them in reverse order.

**sum.asm**: This program computes the sum of a series of positive integers provided as input, separated by the '+' operation.

**spreadsheetCalculator.asm**: This program functions as a simple 1D spreadsheet. Each cell can contain either a positive integer or a formula denoted with the '=' character, referencing other cells. The program accepts the number of cells and their formulas as input, prints all cells in order, and computes the sum of all cells at the end.

## Usage:
reverse.asm: Execute the program in a MIPS environment. Provide the number of lines of input followed by the lines of text, and the program will print them in reverse order.

sum.asm: Run the program in a MIPS environment. Input the series of positive integers separated by '+' signs, and the program will compute and print the sum.

spreadsheetCalculator.asm: Execute the program in a MIPS environment. Input the number of cells and their formulas, and the program will print all cells in order along with the sum of all cells.

**How to Run:**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open each .asm file in a MIPS assembly environment such as QtSpim.
Assemble and execute each program, following the instructions provided above for each program.
